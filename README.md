# This is a python project that demonstrates a simple multilayer perceptron neural network
that is trained using the MNIST dataset. The model flattens the 28x28 pixel image into a
784 element vector. Hence the first layer has 784 neurons, with two hidden middle layers, 
and the outer layer has 10 neurons for the 10 different possible outputs (0 - 9).
